  aboutLong: `
    I am a Creative Software Developer specialized in developing games and interactive simulations. With deep experience in Unreal Engine and Unity, I build complex digital worlds that fully immerse users.

    My technical expertise encompasses multiple programming languages and game development frameworks. I am equally comfortable with C# and Python for backend logic as with JavaScript for web-based projects. What sets me apart is my ability to translate technical complexity into seamless, intuitive user experiences.

    I believe the best games and simulations emerge when creative vision meets solid technical implementation. I enjoy working with teams to go from concept to full product, always focusing on performance, user experience, and visual quality.
